# DoordashProject
This is my first ever Data Science project focused on the dataset from the company Doordash. 
As a delivery driver for Doordash myself for months, I thought this would be a perfect place to start exploring the project experiences 
needed to become a quality data scientist. 
Noticing that Doordash had this case study they gave interviewees to work on, I took it upon myself as a challenge to work on this dataset.
I had a very enjoyable time doign this whole project and I gained many valuable isnights to take into the future with me. 
I have attached a slide presentation of my full analysis to go along with my code and the original dataset as well.
Thank you!
